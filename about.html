                <h2>About Vishasita</h2>
                <p>Vishasita started off as an attempt to apply Machine Learning and NLP techniques to the Indus Script. However, there was no electronic corpus of seal text that was available to the public. While there was one for researchers affiliated to certain institutions, they did not have the processes to share it.</p>
                <p>So why not make one from scratch and share it with the public.</p>
                <p>Right from the very first step one is required to make an interpretation. The lack of a generally adopted decipherment meant that there is no commonly accepted definition of symbols. As an example, while encoding seal text one has to decide whether a symbol is the same <a href=”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyph”>glyph</a> in a different form or a different glyph i.e. (“a” vs “A”) or (“a” vs “b”). This can get complex quickly. “banana” and “Banana” may mean the same thing, but “Apple” and “apple” most likely does not. Arbitrary choices mean that anything one produces, whether it is a font or a search engine, is in effect a de-facto interpretation. It may be wrong and bias results of automated programs.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-12">
              <p>One is unfortunately led down the path of trying to figure out what it takes to decipher the seals. It is possible to show that one cannot logically deduce a decipherment from just the characters alone (e.g. the text on a seal could represent street addresses, people names in crew rosters, words in multiple languages, etc. and any of them could exhibit similar information signatures). It does not matter whether the logical approach is based on language or a computational procedure, the best that one can do is make a guess. What we really need is a Rosetta Stone where we learn what these characters meant from someone who knew.</p>
              <p>Given this situation, a scientific approach is better than a logical one. Open it up so that anyone can come up with a theory. And chances are that the most elegant one, the theory which requires the least leap of faith but explains the maximum number of the facts, is most likely to be correct. At least until something better comes along.</p>
              <p>Vishasita aims to make this process more efficient by cracking open the relevant pieces of the puzzle and making it available to the public. It will attempt at creating a new conceptual framework and its resulting interpretation so that people who are interested can take a look at it and see what works for them. The hope is to create a sufficiently relevant context so that others can reasonably leverage it in their attempts at decipherment.</p>

                <h2>Goals</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>To share a representative set of resources of the Indus Script in a Free and Open manner to the public. This includes the photos of original seals that have gone out of copyright as well as useful resources like an Indus font for efficient sharing online; an electronic corpus of seal text that allows for machine learning and other algorithmic analysis; as well as a seal image search engine so that people can efficiently navigate what is out there.</li>
                  <li>To create and share a reasonable-ish decipherment. This will appear in the form of decisions taken to create the above resources all the way to reading names of peoples, towns, mountains and rivers in the Seals themselves. The hope is to do so in a transparent fashion so that others can leverage our experience.</li>
                  <li>To increase awareness of the mysteries of Indus Civilization among the public. It is today a mute civilization of prehistory; the silent heritage from an unknown people. Perhaps one day we will be able to read what they have written; and see their legacy within ourselves.</li>

              <h2>Non-Goals</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>To prescribe technical solutions. As an example, the Indus Font will at best be a rough and ready solution for writing Indus text but not much more. Although it is hoped that Vishasita's efforts can inform a future attempt at standardization, our users should not expect that other solutions will resemble the one that is being made available here.</li>
                <li>To be a general repository of public domain resources in this field. While we encourage all parties who have resources relevant to the Indus Script to release them in the public domain, they are not expected to do so in Vishasita. We lack the legal resources to help in such an effort and the technical solutions do not need anything we do.</li>
                <li>To be a complete repository. There is nothing about Vishasita that is anything more than a sample and it is at best a somewhat representative one. We will never have the resources to present a complete picture.
                <li>To champion a single solution or decipherment. Vishasita's role is a facilitator rather than an activist or critic. Correct answers will emerge as more minds engage with the problem. Even our own attempt at decipherment aims for validity rather than truth.</li>
